AI-Driven Career Recommendation & Roadmap System
Requirements Specification Document
1. Project Overview

Choosing a career is one of the most critical decisions for students and young professionals. However, most people rely on random suggestions from peers, parents, or generic aptitude tests that only consider academic marks.
This leads to:

Misalignment between personality and job role

Wrong career choices

Repeated job-switching

Lack of clarity and confidence

Our solution:
A full-stack AI-powered career recommendation system that evaluates a user’s personality, interests, skills, preferences, and achievements to generate:

  -Top matching career paths

  -Explanation of why each career matches

  -A personalized short-term & long-term roadmap

  -Skill-gap analysis

  -Interactive visual dashboards

This system acts as a personal career mentor, guiding the user through self-discovery and meaningful career choices.

2. Problem Statement

Students and early professionals often face confusion about:

What career they are actually suited for

What skills they lack

Which roles match their natural personality traits

How to transition from where they are → where they want to be

How to create a real, structured career plan

Current solutions are inadequate because:

They only analyze marks or academic scores

They do not consider personality or real interests

They provide generic recommendations without personalization

They offer no roadmap for execution

Therefore, we need a system that is:
✔ Psychologically grounded
✔ Data-driven
✔ Personalized
✔ Actionable
✔ Deployable as a real, working product
